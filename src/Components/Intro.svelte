    Welcome to a dynamic exploration of survival prediction aboard the Titanic. This interactive web experience uses a detailed dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> to allow you to engage directly with machine learning models. By entering hypothetical passenger details, you can predict survival outcomes based on historical data, exploring the influence of various factors like ticket class, age, and number of relatives on board.

  <p class="body-text">
    Dive into the heart of predictive modeling through our three-tiered approach:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Model:</strong> Utilizes basic passenger data such as ticket class and fare to predict survival. This model serves as an introduction to the impact of socio-economic status on survival chances.</li>
      <li><strong>Intermediate Model:</strong> Enhances predictions by including age and sex, providing deeper insights into demographic influences on survival rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Model:</strong> Incorporates comprehensive data, including familial relationships and embarkation points, offering a nuanced understanding of survival probabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    Each model builds in complexity, demonstrating how adding different types of data can refine predictions and provide greater insights into historical events.
